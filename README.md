# Componentable

A Godot Plugin to create generic components to your project's logic to make better maintenance

> Works only on Godot 4.x versions

<br>

### ‚ú® New Version 2.0 ‚ú®

- Added new UI tab for componentable, easy to create, modify components and see current values
- Automatic creation of componentable and components
- New icons for components
- Many bugs fixed

#### Future plans

- Create a UI Editor for all values from components, so you don't need to select component nodes to change values

## üìü What is Componentable?

The main goal of the Componentable is to create components to some classes to share responsibility between nodes.

### Why use Components?

![Structure Comparation with componentable and without](images/componentable_compare.png)

With this you can split the logic in many scripts with low code, and you can customize some behaviours for many nodes with same scene

### Componentable Flow

![](images/component_flow.png)
The componentable flow is the componentable will always be required, so when you create a component will always have a variable with the componentable as value, but componentable can call the component but the component could not exist.

## üîß Installation

- You can search "Componentable" on Godot Assets Library
- You can download this repo, copy and paste the `addons/componentable` into your project's folder

<br>

## üìù Getting Started

### Creating a Component

To start just select a node and in the "Componentable" tab click on `Create Componentable`

Then select a path and a name to your component, will create a Componen
> Node don't need to have a script, componentable can be used with build-in types

So for in our component example `Glowing` will make the player glow with:

```godot
class_name Glowing extends PlayerComponent

#You can access the variable player to get the parent of this component, that is a class named Player

func _ready():
	if active: # active is a variable inside PlayerComponent to make some enabling behaviours
		create_tween().tween_property(player, "modulate:a", 0, 1)
```

then you select the `Componentable` node you can select the component

<br>

![](images/enabling_component.png)

> This list of components will show all components that is from this node type and node parent types

when selected a component will show up as a node in components node of your `Componentable`

<br>

![Alt text](images/component_node.png)

Here you can see that we have two variables `player` that will be automatic assign as the `Componentable` Node, and the `active` variable, that will disable the behavior in your logic.

You can make more exported variables to create more customization to your component

<br>

### Getting a Component from a Node

When you want to get a component from a `Componentable`, you can use:

```godot
var glowing: Glowing = Component.find(self, "Glowing")
```

If you want to get a component from a other node, you can use:

```godot
var glowing: Glowing = Component.find(player, "Glowing")
```

> Just remember the component can be null

<br>

### Adding or removing component in runtime

To add a component to a componentable in runtime you can use:

```godot
Component.subscribe(node, "ComponentName")
```

and to remove a component you can use:

```godot
Component.unsubscribe(node, "ComponentName")
```

<br>

### Some others functions

```godot
Component.has(node, "component") # return true if this componentable have this component

Component.get_all(node) # return all components in this componentable
```

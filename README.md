## üìü What is Componentable?

The main goal of the Componentable is to create components to some classes to share responsibility between nodes.

### Why use Components?

With this you can split the logic in many scripts with low code, and you can customize some behaviours for many nodes with same scene

Example of selection of components on Componentable

### Componentable Flow

![](images/component_flow.png)
The componentable flow is the componentable will always be required, so when you create a component will always have a variable with the componentable as value, but componentable can call the component but the component could not exist.

## üîß Installation

- You can search "Componentable" on Godot Assets Library
- You can download this repo, copy and paste the `addons/componentable` into your project's folder

## üìù Getting Started

### Creating a Componentable

To start just select a node and in the inspector click on `Create Componentable`

![Inspector with a Create Componentable Button](images/create_componentable.png)

Then will be create a Component Script for your node, and your node will be ready to have components

In this example, the Component Script created will be `PlayerComponent`, because de class_name of the script in this node is Progress.

> Node don't need to have a script, componentable can be used with build-in types

<br>

### Creating a Component

Just create a Script with a `class_name` and extends `PlayerComponent`, then you can place the behaviour you want inside this component.

in the `PlayerComponent` we have:

```godot
class_name PlayerComponent extends Node

@export var active = true
@export var player: Player
```

so we can access the player using the `player` variable.

<br>

So for in our component example `Glowing` will make the player glow with:

```godot
class_name Glowing extends PlayerComponent

func _ready():
	if active: # active is a variable inside PlayerComponent to make some enabling behaviours
		create_tween().tween_property(player, "modulate:a", 0, 1)
```

then you select the `Componentable` node you can select the component

<br>

![](images/enabling_component.png)

> This list of components will show all components that is from this node type and node parent types

when selected a component will show up as a node in components node of your `Componentable`

<br>

![Alt text](images/component_node.png)

Here you can see that we have two variables `player` that will be automatic assign as the `Componentable` Node, and the `active` variable, that will disable the behavior in your logic.

You can make more exported variables to create more customization to your component

<br>

### Getting a Component from a Node

When you want to get a component from a `Componentable`, you can use:

```godot
var glowing: Glowing = Component.find(self, "Glowing")
```

If you want to get a component from a other node, you can use:

```godot
var glowing: Glowing = Component.find(player, "Glowing")
```

> Just remember the component can be null

<br>

### Adding or removing component in runtime

To add a component to a componentable in runtime you can use:

```godot
Component.subscribe(node, "ComponentName")
```

and to remove a component you can use:

```godot
Component.unsubscribe(node, "ComponentName")
```

<br>

### Some others functions

```godot
Component.componentable(node) # will create a Component Script if don't exists to this node, and define this node as a componentable

Component.uncomponentable(node) # will make this node not a Componentable any more

Component.is_componentable(node) # return true if this node is a componentable

Component.has(node, "component") # return true if this componentable have this component

Component.get_all(node) # return all components in this componentable
```
